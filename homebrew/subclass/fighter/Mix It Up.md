# Fighter Subclass: Mix it Up!
## Description
The archetypal "Mix it up!" focuses on mixing melee attacks with ranged 
attacks resulting in a deadly combination. Dangerous for users and foes 
alike, those who choose this archetype must truly be a daredevil.

This subclasses combat abilities shine during long combat encounters 
and forces the player to switch efficiently between melee weapons and 
ranged weapons. If they can do so they will be able to perform powerful 
maneuvers similar to those of the Battle Master archetype, with the 
exception that there is no limit to them in a combat encounter.

## Abilities
### Level 3 (When you select this archetype)
- **Quick Swap**
    - You learn to quickly switch between weapons in combat. You can 
    now sheathe a weapon and then draw a different weapon as a single 
    interaction
        - You can not use this feature while you wield both a weapon 
        and a shield
        - If the weapon you want to draw using this feature has the 
        **Heavy** property you must also spend your bonus action 
        in addition to your interaction to draw it
- **Stylish Fighter**
    - You learn to perform [special maneuvers](#maneuvers) using both 
    melee and ranged weapons
        - You learn 3 maneuvers at 3<sup>rd</sup> level
        - You can learn an additional maneuver at 7<sup>th</sup>, 
        10<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th</sup> level
            - Each time you learn an additional maneuver you can also 
            replace one 
            maneuver you know with a different one
            - At the DM's discretion you can also replace one maneuver 
            you know 
            with a different one after a long rest
    - Some of these maneuvers require your targets to make a saving 
    throw  
    The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: `DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + dex mod`
    - You can use only one maneuver per attack
        - You can still use multiple maneuvers in a single turn, but 
        they can not 
        affect the same attack in any way
    - Using any of these maneuvers requires a new resource: **Style Points (SP)**
    - When you enter combat, you start with **0 SP**
    - During combat you can gain **SP** by attacking in a different way 
    than previously
        - Possible attack sequences and more information can be found 
        [here](#attacking-in-a-different-way-than-before)
        - An attack must hit, but not deal damage, to grant any **SP**
    - **When you take damage, you lose 1 SP. This can only happens once until your next turn!**

### Level 5
- **Quick Reflexes**
    - This ability has **2 charges**. When you provoke an opportunity attack from 
    a creature that you can see, you can spend a charge so the opportunity attack 
    happens with disadvantage
    - You regain **all charges** after a short or long rest

### Level 7
- **Mixing the Pain**
    - Immediately after every successful attack, you can use **Quick Swap** once 
    for free

### Level 10
- **Enhanced Reflexes**
    - Number of charges of **Quick Reflexes** increased to **4 charges**
- **Critical Style**
    - When you score a critical hit on a creature you gain an additional **style point (SP)**

### Level 15
- **Vicious Intent**
    - Your attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20

### Level 18
- **Perfect Reflexes**
     - Replaces **Quick Reflexes**
     - All opportunity attacks against you, from creatures that you can see, 
     happen with disadvantage

## Maneuvers
**Disarming Attack (Both)**:  
When you make an attack, you can spend **2 SP** to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save the target will the drop the specified object. The object lands 10 ft. away from the target in a random direction (d6, direction is clockwise).

**Tripping Attack (Both)**:  
When you make an attack, you can spend **2 SP** to attempt to knock the target 
down. When you hit the target with the attack and the target is large or smaller, 
it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save you knock the target prone.

**Feinting Strike (Melee)**:  
You can spend **2 SP** and your bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one 
creature within 5 ft. of you as your target. You have advantage on your next 
attack roll against that creature. The advantage is lost if not used the turn you 
gain it.

**Lunging Strike (Melee)**:  
When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can spend **2 SP** to 
increase your reach of that attack by 5 ft.

**Sweeping Attack (Melee)**:  
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend **2 SP** to 
attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. You must choose another 
creature within 5 ft. of the original target and within your reach. If the 
original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to half 
of the damage the original target took (rounded towards 1). The damage is of the 
same type dealt as the original damage.

**Intercept Missile (Melee)**:  
When you or an ally within 5 ft. is targeted by a missile from a ranged weapon 
attack, you can use your reaction and spend **2 SP** to attempt to deflect the 
projectile. You must succeed an Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against a DC set by 
the DM for the missile. If you succeed, the damage dealt by the attack is 0. 

**Precision Shot (Ranged)**:  
You can spend **2 SP** and your bonus action to aim especially carefully at a 
creature. You gain advantage on your next ranged weapon attack against that 
creature. The advantage is lost if not used this turn.

**Overwatch Stance (Ranged)**:  
At the end of your turn, you can choose to spend **2 SP** to lock down an area. 
Until the start of your next turn, the next hostile creature you can see that 
moves at least 5 ft. on their turn within your ranged weapon's range provokes a 
ranged opportunity attack from you. You use your reaction to take this shot.

**Piercing Shot (Ranged)**:  
When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can spend **3 SP** 
to attempt to fire through multiple opponents. The initial attack gains **-3 to 
hit**. On a hit the target suffers normal damage, and you make an attack roll 
with disadvantage against every creature in a line directly behind the target 
within your first range increment.

**Overcharged Shot (Ranged)**:  
When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can spend **3 SP** 
to overcharge your ranged weapon. The attack roll happens with a **-3 to hit**. 
If the attack hits you can roll 1 additional damage die when determining the 
damage.

**Rain of Arrows (Ranged) (Requires Level 10 or higher)**:  
You can use your action and spend **4 SP** to make a ranged attack against any 
number of creatures within 5 ft. of a point that you can see within your weapons 
range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a 
separate attack roll for each target.

## Attacking in a different way than before
- In essence, the player using this subclass is supposed to alternate between 
using melee weapons and ranged weapons to strike opponents and is rewarded with a 
single **SP** every time they try to do so.
    - With Extra Attack the player is thus able to gain multiple **SP** per Attack Action if they choose to take the risk to repeatedly enter and leave an opponentâ€™s reach.
- Following is a list of example combinations that grant **SP** and another list of example combinations that do not grant **SP**:
    - Working examples
        - Melee weapon attack &#8594; Ranged weapon attack
        - Ranged weapon attack &#8594; Melee weapon attack
        - Special action &#8594; Melee / Ranged weapon attack
        - Melee / Ranged weapon attack &#8594; Special action
        - Nothing (Start of combat) &#8594; Melee / Ranged weapon attack, special action
    - Not working examples
        - Melee weapon attack &#8594; Melee weapon attack
        - Ranged weapon attack &#8594; Ranged weapon attack
        - Special action &#8594; Special action
- Actions enhanced by maneuvers do not grant **SP**
    - Critical hits with **Critical Style** still grant their bonus **SP**
- Special actions are actions that can be used instead of an attack, like shoving or grappling, and spells that damage one or more opponents.
